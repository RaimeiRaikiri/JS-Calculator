# JS-Calculator

The aim of this repository is to test my skills in using html, css and javascript together. Creating an on screen calculator using all 3 is a great way to do so as it can be done most efficiently and presentably using a combination of the 3.

To build the calculator:

- To start off with a html skeleton of a container to hold all elements in the shape of a calculator.
- This container should be center of the screen the screen, requiring css.
- Then buttons to hold the each number from 0-9 and operations are in order.
- These should be spaced like a calculator using css.
- Then a location for the calculation and result to be displayed is to be made from html and then positioned at the top of the container with css.
- Next the logic, functions for each button with a number and operator should be made in javascript.
- Event listeners can then be added for the click of each button to call their corresponding function using javascript.
- The results of the functions should be displayed on the display screen using javascript.
- Once the basic functionality and structure is in order we can move onto styling using a combination of css and javascript.
